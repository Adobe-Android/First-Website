Web-Feature-Documentation
============
This is a repository that documents how to write basic web functions. I originally wrote this when I was first learning HTML5 and CSS3. I will update pieces of the code over time. As the license states, you can do pretty much anything you want with this code. Refer to the LICENSE file for more specific information. The next major changes might be a while, but will drastically change the look and function. 

Update: 10/30/15 *I am redoing everything to make this a solid learning tool rather than the garbage you currently see. Everything will be well documented. Look forward to the new code drop when I'm done.
